You can achieve this by iterating through the text and identifying the '^' characters. Then check the next character to determine if it is a number followed by a punctuation mark or space, indicating a footnote.
By keeping track of these occurrences, count the number of '^' characters and determine if each one can be an exponentiation or used as a footnote.
Finally, output the count of '^' characters and two lines indicating if each '^' character can be a power or a footnote based on analysis.
