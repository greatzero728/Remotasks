There are n bacteria, and i_th bacteria is in flask s_i. (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) There are three flasks in the lab.
You did q experiments, and in the i_th stage, you moved the bacterium from the flask x_i to the flask y_i. (0 ≤ q ≤ 100, 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 3, x_i != y_i)
Given the description of the final location of n bacteria, you have to determine whether this is a valid result.
