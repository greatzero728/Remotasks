Alice and Bob are playing the Mex game.
Before the game started, S = {a_1, a_2,..., a_n} was given.
Two players alternate moves, and Alice moves first.
During one's move, he or she could choose an arbitrary integer x and insert x into S.
After k rounds, each player made k updates, and the winner was determined as follows:
St. Alice wins if Mex (S) is even, and Bob wins otherwise.
Two players are very smart, so both of them made optimal moves.
Determine winner.
