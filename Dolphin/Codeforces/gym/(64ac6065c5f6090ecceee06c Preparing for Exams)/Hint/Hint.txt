Let's denote the area of triangle ABC as ABC and the length of line segment AB as AB.
Then, oda = od * oa * sin(al) / 2. (Here, al is the angle between two half line.)
So, you can calculate the value of sin(al).
And because obc = ob * oc * sin(al) / 2, you can calculate ob * oc.
And using the od * oc = oa * ob theory, you can calculate oc / ob.
So using two values, ob * oc and oc / ob, you can calculate ob and oc.
Finally, you can calculate dc and ab as following:
dc = oc - od, ad = ob - oa.
