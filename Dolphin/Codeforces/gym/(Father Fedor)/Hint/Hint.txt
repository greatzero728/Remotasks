First, you can connect with A[0] and A[i] in weight 0 and check if the shortest path is in range.
Then, maintaining the current shortest path, you can connect edges with A[0] and A[i - 1].
You have to control whether the shortest path will go in the correct range.
By doing this, if you notice that it's impossible, you can terminate immediately.
Overall, you only need to add or delete edge(A[0], A[i])
