You can consider each change in the state of the teleports as an event and process these events accordingly. Keep track of all active teleports and the distances between them.
When a teleport turns on, calculate the new distances. Otherwise, adjust the distances accordingly.
Use an appropriate map structure to efficiently insert and remove teleports, and another one to keep track of distances between active teleports.
After every event, calculate the maximum time it would take to travel between two points on the circle, given the current state of the teleports and the player's speed.
