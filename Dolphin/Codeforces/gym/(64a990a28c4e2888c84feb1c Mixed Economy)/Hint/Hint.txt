To solve this problem, you have to do two things:
1. Figure out how much each person has in their bank account before the tax.
2. Find the person who needs to pay the tax and figure out how much they need to pay.
The first task is simple enough; you can iterate through the spending list and keep track of each person’s bank account using a map or an equivalent data structure.
For the second task, you will iterate through the list and keep track of two variables: a and b. a is the length of the longest spending streak by any person so far, and b is the length of the current spending streak. Whenever the spending list switches to another person, we reset b to 1. Every time b surpasses a, we set a to b and label the person we are currently iterating through as the one that pays the tax. After doing this, we simply subtract a·(N −1) dollars from the taxed person and give a dollars to everyone else.
To get the answer, just find the person with the least amount of money and subtract that value from the person with the most money.
