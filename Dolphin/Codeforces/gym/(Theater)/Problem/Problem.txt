The stage is a rectangle of size W by L meters, and there are N backlights. (1 ≤ W, L ≤ 50, 1 ≤ N ≤ 15)
A can move at a maximum speed of V1 meters per second, and B can move at a maximum speed of V2 meters per second. (1 ≤ V1, V2 ≤ 20) A can only turn on the lights, and B can only turn them off. A starts on the left side of the stage, and B starts on the right side.
The lamps that need to be turned on and off for each action are specified in a script.
Before the first action, the necessary lamps are already turned on.
The goal is to minimize the total time between actions.
