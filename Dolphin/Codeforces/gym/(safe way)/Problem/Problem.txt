The problem is finding the minimum total angle that a driver A will have to turn in order to reach his friend's house B.
The city is represented by a set of roads and intersections, and A's house and B's house are located on different roads. A's excitement, or worry, is directly proportional to the angle at which he turns.
Calculate the minimum total excitement that A will experience when he reaches B's house. If it is not possible for A to reach B's house, the output will be -1.
