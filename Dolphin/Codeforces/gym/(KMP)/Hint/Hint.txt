You can solve this using a simple dynamic program.
First, you have to count out the number of integers in the sequence. (Let's denote num[i] as the number of occurrences of i in a given sequence.)
Let's denote ans[i] as the number of good sequences, whose maximum value is i.
If you calculate ans[1], ans[2], ..., ans[i - 1], then you can calculate ans[i] as follows:
ans[i] = ans[i-1] * num[i] + num[i]
