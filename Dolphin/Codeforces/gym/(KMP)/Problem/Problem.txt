Given an array S whose length is N, you have to calculate the number of good subsequences of S in modulo 1000000007.
The good sequence is defined as having all its numbers different and containing every integer value between the minimum number in the sequence and the maximum number in the sequence.
(1 ≤ N, S_i ≤ 10^5)
