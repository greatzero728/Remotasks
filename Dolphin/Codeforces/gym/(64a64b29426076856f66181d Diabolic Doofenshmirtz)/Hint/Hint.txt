Try to find t such that x ≤ t < 2 · x.
The answer is then simply t − t % x.
How to find the right t:
Since x could be 1, we can only try t = 1 as the first query. If this t is less than x, you know that x is at least 2.
Thus, the largest possible t we can now try is t = 3. If this t is less than x, you know that x is at least 4.
Thus, the largest possible t we can now try is t = 7. If this t is less than x, you know that x is at least 8.
Finally, try t = 2^i − 1 until t mod x != t.
Then answer with t − (t mod x)
