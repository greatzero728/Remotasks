There are n bus stops in the city, through which k-ring bus routes pass.
The i_th route passes through stops a_i_1, a_i_2, ..., a_i_l in given order, and there is exactly one bus on the route.
At time 0, this bus is at stop a_i_1. To get to the next stop on its stopping route, the bus takes exactly one minute. All routes are circular.
The plan of the j_th Person consists of a stop b_j, at which the person will start rolling, and sequences of Numbers c_j_1, c_j_2, ..., c_j_m. The person will move c_j_1, c_j_2, ..., c_j_m in the given order.
If, at some point, several buses arrive at the stop at once, then the person will get on the bus with the minimum route number.
For each Person, print the time in minutes when he will ride and the number of the stop where it will happen. If a person cannot realize his plan to the end, print two zeros for him.
