For each person, simulate their movement along the bus stops based on their sequence of moves.
Then iterate through the move sequence, find the next bus stop that matches the move condition, and update the current stop and time accordingly.
If a person's plan is completed, then print the final time and current stop.
If the plan cannot be realized, then print "0 0".
