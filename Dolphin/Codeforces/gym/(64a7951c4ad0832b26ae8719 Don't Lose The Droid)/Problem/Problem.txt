You have to travel for T days in the N × M grid. (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ N × M ≤ 10^6)
Each day, you have to move from the current cell to another adjacent cell with the given character.
C : You have to move upwords.
D : You have to move rightwards.
B : You have to move downloads.
E : You have to move leftwards.
You can start in any cell in the grid, but during the trip, you can't go outside the grid.
Your task is to find out the possible cells that you can access at the end of the trip.
You can first implement the trip for T days by brute force.
Here, you can find the range of your trip. (For example, minimum/maximum of x/y.)
Using this range, you can guess the final position of your trip on the grid.
