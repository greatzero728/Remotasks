You can model the river as a graph and find the shortest distance from the left bank to the right bank. Each water lily is a node in the graph, and the edges represent possible jumps between the lilies. You can handle the scenario of waiting for submerged lilies to resurface by creating multiple vertices for each lily at a time.
By starting the search from the left bank with any initial delay, you can account for the waiting time before the first jump.
After exploring all possible paths, you only need to find the minimum time needed to cross the river. If there is no reachable water lily in the rightmost column, output -1 to indicate that crossing is impossible.
