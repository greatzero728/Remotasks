You have to check for a line of five consecutive 'X's or 'O's in a given n Ã— m grid.
Iterates over each position in the grid, and for each position, check in eight directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) if there are five consecutive characters of the same type.
If such a line is found, then print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".
