You can use graph theory and backtracking to solve this problem.
Starting from each city, explore all possible paths, following the condition that adjacent roads must have different landscape types.
You can use a recursive approach to traverse the graph and maintain a list of visited roads.
If you find a valid cyclic tour, return the length of the tour and the road numbers.
If no valid tour is found in any city, we return -1.
