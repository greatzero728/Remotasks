Given a graph that contains N vertices, M edges, and F special vertices.
All edges are given as three integers X Y Z(1 ≤ X, Y ≤ N, 1 ≤ Z ≤ 1000) which represent an undirected edge between the X_th vertex and the Y_th vertex.
Also, N special vertices are given.
You have to find the shortest path from 1 to N, which includes all special vertices.
You can pass by any vertex more than once.
