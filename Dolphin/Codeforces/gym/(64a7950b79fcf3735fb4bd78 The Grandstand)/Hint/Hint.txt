There is a method to find out H, S, U, and T.
H, S, and T have two empty rectangles, and U has one empty rectangle.
For H, the two empty rectangles are located at the bottom and top.
For S, the two empty rectangles are located on the left and right.
For T, the two empty rectangles are located at the bottom left and bottom right.
And then, finally, you have to check if all widths of character are the same in the arbitrarily oriented direction.
