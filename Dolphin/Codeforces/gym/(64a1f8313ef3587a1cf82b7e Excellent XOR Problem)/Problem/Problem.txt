You are given an array [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] of integers in the range [0, 2^30]. (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
You have to divide it into several (more than one) consecutive subarrays whose weights are distinct.
(The weight of subarray [L, R] is a_L ^ a_L+1 ^ ... ^ a_R.)
Determine if this is possible.
If possible, find one of these partitions.
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000), the number of test cases.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.
