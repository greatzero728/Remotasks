Each box of chocolates has dimensions of a × b × c centimeters. You want to use one large box in the shape of a rectangular box, parallelized, to transport sweets. All boxes of chocolates must be placed in the box. In order not to damage them, all the boxes in the box must maintain their original orientation and be located in the same direction. You can use a box of any size, but the size of a box in the sum of its three dimensions cannot exceed N centimeters.
Given the numbers N, a, b, and c, calculate the length, width, and height of the box that you should choose and that will fit the maximum number of boxes of chocolates. (1 ≤ N, a, b, c ≤ 10^9)
If there are several suitable answers, print any of them.
