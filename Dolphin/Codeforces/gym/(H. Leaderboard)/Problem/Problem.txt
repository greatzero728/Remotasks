Given the information about the programming contest, simulate the final results.
The number of problems, N and the number of submitted solutions, M(1 ≤ N ≤ 26, 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^5) are given.
The next N lines describe the solutions. Each of them contains a number T_i, a string S_i, symbols P_i and R_i(0 ≤ T_i ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ |S_i| ≤ 20, 'A' ≤ P_i ≤ 'Z', R_i = '+'(or, '-')) — the time the solution was sent, the name of the participant who sent the solution, the task identifier, and the result of the check.
T_i is the time of sending the i_th solution from the start of the competition, specified in minutes.
The names of participants consist only of lowercase Latin letters and underscores. Task identifiers belong to the set of the first N capital letters of the Latin alphabet. The lines describing the solutions are ordered in the non-decreasing order of the values of T_i.
S_i is the name of the participant who sent the i_th solution.
P_i — identifier (letter) of the problem for which the i_th solution was submitted.
R_i — the result of checking the i_th solution: '+' — the solution is counted, '-' — the solution is not counted.
Based on this information, the content of the tournament table is formed in accordance with the general rules. (See full description and example.)
Output the tournament table, drawn up and formatted in accordance with the rules.
