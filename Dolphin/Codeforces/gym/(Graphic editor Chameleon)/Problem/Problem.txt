There is a current n × n grid of colors and a desired final n × n grid of colors. (5 ≤ n ≤ 100)
Your task is to transform the initial grid into the final grid by performing a series of cell movements and color changes.
The grid is represented as a square matrix, where each cell can be either black (B) or white (W).
Find a sequence of moves and color changes that will result in the final grid.
