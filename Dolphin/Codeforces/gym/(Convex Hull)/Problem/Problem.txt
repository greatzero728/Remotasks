There are n points whose coordinates are integers x_i and y_i (3 ≤ n ≤ 100000, |x_i|, |y_i| ≤ 10^9)
Find the number of points with integer coordinates that are strictly inside the convex hull of the given set of n points.
The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the given points.
No two points match. Among the given points, there are three that do not lie on one straight line.
