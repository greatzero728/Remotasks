You can solve this problem with Graham's scan and Pick's theorem.
First, you can get the convex hull of a given set of points using Graham's scan algorithm.
Once the convex hull is found, you need to calculate the area and the number of boundary lattice points to determine the number of interior lattice points using Pick's theorem.
