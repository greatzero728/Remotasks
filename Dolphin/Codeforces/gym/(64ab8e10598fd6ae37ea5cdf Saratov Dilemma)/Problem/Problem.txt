There are one-seat and two-seat beds in the hotel.
The number of one-seat beds is a, and the number of two-seat beds is b.
There are n people in the hotel.
There are n people, and among them there are people who agree to sleep with someone together on a double bet, but there are also people who are against it.
Knowing these data, distribute the beds among the people.
(1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 0 ≤ a + b ≤ 200000)
The information is given as a string s, which contains n characters, such as 0' or '1'.
If s_i = 1, then i_th person can sleep with someone together on a double bed; otherwise, i_th person can't sleep with someone together on a double bed.
In the first line, print "YES" or "NO" depending on whether it is possible to distribute people according to sleeping places or not.
If the answer is yes, print more a + b lines.
The first a line should contain one-seat information, and the next b line should contain two-seat information.
If there is not a man in one bed, you can describe it as 0.
