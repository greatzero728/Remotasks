There is a rectangle whose width is A and length is B. (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10000)
You can draw a circle whose radius is R (1 ≤ R ≤ 20000) and whose center is not inside the given rectangle.
Your task is to maximize the area, which includes both a rectangle and a circle.
Calculate the maximum area.
The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10^-6.
