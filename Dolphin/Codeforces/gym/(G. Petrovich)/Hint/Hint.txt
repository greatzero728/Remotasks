Let's assume that the longer edge is A and the other edge is B.
Then you can easily find that the center of the circle is the middle point of edge A.
Then, you can split the rectangle (A, B) into two rectangles (A / 2, B) and multiply the common area of the rectangle (A / 2, B) and circle R by two to get the answer.
You can check special cases (e.g., rectangle (A / 2, B) is fully in a circle) and then generally find all the intersecting points between circle and rectangle, calculate the area of each part, and then sum them.
