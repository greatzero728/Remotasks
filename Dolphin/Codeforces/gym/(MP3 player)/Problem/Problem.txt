You have a playlist of songs, and you are going to shuffle the songs randomly, but you ensure that no two songs that were originally consecutive remain in the shuffled playlist.
Calculate the number of possible rearrangements of the playlist that satisfy this condition.
Given the number of songs in the playlist n and a modulo value m, your task is to output the count of valid rearrangements modulo m.
The constraints are 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000 and 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9.
