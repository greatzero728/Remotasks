You can solve this problem by using dynamic programming.
You can iteratively calculate the number of valid rearrangements for each song, considering the previous two songs and their valid rearrangements.
The resulting count is obtained by applying the modulo operation to the final value of dp[n]. (You have to apply modulo operations at each step to avoid overflow.)
