Determine the base division based on the participant's rating.
Check if the base division is present in the competition divisions, and if so, print it and end.
If the base division is not present, iterate through the competition divisions.
Print the divisions that are lower than the base division.
For divisions higher than the base division, print them followed by '*' to indicate the participant will compete out of the competition. Ensure the divisions are printed in ascending order.
