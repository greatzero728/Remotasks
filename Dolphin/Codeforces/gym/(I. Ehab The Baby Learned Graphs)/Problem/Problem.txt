The xor of two undirected graphs is defined as follows:
The resulting graph has the same number of vertices, and an edge exists in it if and only if it exists in exactly one of the two input graphs.
An undirected and connected graph that contains n vertices and m edges is given as n×n grid (adjacent matrix). Find at most n+m trees consisting of n where the following constraints are satisfied:
1. His graph is the xor of them. The xor of one tree is itself. The xor of t>1 trees is (the xor of the first t−1 trees) xor (the last tree).
2. If you take the diameter of each tree and take the maximum of them, the result should be as small as possible. The diameter of a tree is the length of its longest path.
