Given an n Ã— n matrix and one integer k, choose k elements in each row in such a way that there are k elements chosen in each column and the sum of the chosen elements is as minimal as possible.
(Each element in a given matrix is in the range [-1000, 1000]).
You have to print the minimal sum of the selected elements.
