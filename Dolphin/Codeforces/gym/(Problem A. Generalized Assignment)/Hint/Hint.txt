You can solve this problem using the min-cost-max-flow algorithm.
Let's consider all rows as source vertices and all columns as target vertices, and then all n Ã— n elements as the edge from source vertex to target vertex.
Then the state of the selected edges will be considered the minimum cost for maximum flow.
You only need to print the minimum cost.
