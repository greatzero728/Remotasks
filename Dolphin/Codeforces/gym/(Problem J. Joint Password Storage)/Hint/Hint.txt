In the following cases, you can't find a valid solution:
1. Bit 64 is in all letters. But in expressions, it is only in [] and {}.
2. Parentheses in an expression are always even, so letters must be even.
3. Of bits 64 and 32, there is exactly one everywhere except {}
4. If the string is of even length, then the bit will always be even in the entire string.
5. It means that in even lines, there are separate large and small letters.
6. Everything else is possible!
In other cases, you can find a valid solution.
You can find a set of 7*n-1 or 7*n-2 linearly independent expressions. Then find the answer to one password using the Gauss method. Take random elements of the set until there are enough.
One approach is to use random generation along with the Gauss method to find a set of linearly independent expressions.
The Gaussian method is then used to solve for the expansion into rows from the selected set of expressions.
