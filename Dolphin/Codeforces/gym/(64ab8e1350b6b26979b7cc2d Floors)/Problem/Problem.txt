A and B live in a round building with n entrances.
Each entrance has m floors and k apartments.
A wants to find out the minimum time it takes for him to reach B's apartment.
A can move between floors using stairs or an elevator. The elevator takes 1 second to move between floors and arrives 10 seconds after being called. If he doesn't use the elevator, then it takes 5 seconds to move between floors.
Moving between adjacent entrances takes 15 seconds, while moving between apartments on the same floor is instant.
The goal is to calculate the minimum time for A to reach B's apartment based on the given layout of the building and the locations of their apartments.
Each n × m × k apartment is naturally numbered from 1 to n × m × k.
The c_th apartment of the b_th floor of the a_th entrance has the number (((a - 1) * m) + b - 1) * k + c + 1.
(1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000)
