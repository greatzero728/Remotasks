There are n × m grid which total no more than 8 cells are initially infected. (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100)
Every second, among uninfected cells that have an infected cell in the adjacent cell, exactly one cell becomes infected with the virus.
Find out the number of configurations of infected cells that can be obtained in t seconds. (1 ≤ t ≤ 6)
