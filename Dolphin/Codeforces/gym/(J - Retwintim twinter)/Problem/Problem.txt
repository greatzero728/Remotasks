You have to reformat a twint chain, where each twint is a message.
The initial twint chain had a length limit of 140 characters, but now it has been increased to 280 characters.
The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤  5000), indicating the number of twints in the initial chain.
Each twint is provided on a separate line and ends with "(i/n)" to indicate the twint's number and the total number of twints.
Your task is to reformat the twint chain into as few twints as possible without breaking up words, while adhering to the new character limit of 280.
The output must include the number of twints in the reformatted chain and the reformatted twints.
