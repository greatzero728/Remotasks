You can utilize a binary search approach to find the maximum number of twints that can fit within the character limit of 280.
You can iteratively check if the current number of twints, divided into lines, can be accommodated within the character limit.
If it is possible, update the answer and continue searching for a larger number of twints.
Otherwise, reduce the search range and try with a smaller number of twints.
Finally, output the number of twints and format the twints by adding the twint number and total number of twints at the end of each twint.
